# External Dependencies
This project depends on python3-spot

On Ubuntu, I downloaded the latest release 2.9.8 from [here](https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/install.html)

After the typical configure, make, make install, the Python package is located at `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site_packages` so I just copied it to the site-packages directory in my virtual environment

@TODO more robust / automatic installation for ^^^^
